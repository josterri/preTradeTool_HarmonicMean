        This chart shows the distribution of **basis-point differences** between the **arithmetic** and **harmonic** mean execution prices across all Monte Carlo simulations.
        
        - **Œî (bps)** represents how much higher the arithmetic mean is compared to the harmonic mean, on average across all simulations.
        - A value of **{delta_mean:.1f} bps** means that, on average, the arithmetic mean overstates the effective execution price by **{delta_mean/100:.1f} %**.
        - The **standard deviation of {delta_std:.1f} bps** indicates large variability across simulations.
        
        ---
        
        ### üí° Key Takeaways
        
        - The **harmonic mean** is consistently **lower** than the arithmetic mean due to the nature of fixed-dollar execution: you buy **more shares when prices are low** and **fewer shares when prices are high**, which the harmonic mean accounts for.
        - Using the arithmetic mean as a performance benchmark can **overstate execution quality** by {delta_mean:.1f} basis points on average.
        - The long right tail in the histogram shows that in some scenarios, the overstatement can exceed **{delta_std*3:.1f} bps to {delta_std*4:.1f} bps and more**, especially in volatile price paths.
        
        ---
        
        ### ‚úÖ Conclusion
        
        In fixed-notional buyback strategies, the **harmonic mean** is the correct benchmark.  
        **Outperforming the arithmetic mean does not imply execution skill** ‚Äî it simply reflects the mechanical advantage built into the strategy.
